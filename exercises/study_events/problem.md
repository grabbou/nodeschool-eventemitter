# Study events

## Boilerplate

Before you begin, define and export function with following signature:

```js
// Don't forget to export your method
module.export = function (nodeschool) {

}
```

that accepts one argument, which is `NodeSchool` event emitter.

## Goal

Your goal is simple. NodeSchool is so popular, that newStudents appear every couple of seconds.

Subscribe to `newStudent` event and print message of your choice when this particular event occurs.

You may receive random number of students each time you run your code! That's fun!
